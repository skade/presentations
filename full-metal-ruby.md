## The Ruby community
{:.cover .Picture .RubyCommunity}

![](pictures/full_metal/ruby_community.png)


## There is no Ruby community
{:.cover .Picture .RubyCommunities}

![](pictures/full_metal/ruby_communities.png)

## There is no Ruby community

> The Ruby community is broken!

> Which?

## There is no Ruby community

> Let's fix the Ruby community!

> Which?

## The Ruby community

* very opinion-driven and personal
* clashes are often
* values curiosity
* definitely imperfect
* MINSWAN (Matz is nice so we are nice)

## International

* Many Rubyists don't speak english
* MRI is a multilingual project
* There is a translation service for the core ML!
* There is a huge translation team for the website!
* That causes problems, but is also a great achievement!

## Very pragmatic and quick

* Willing to replace old stuff
* Willing to get behind things
  - Technology
  - Social things (Rails Girls)

## **Technology**

## Online communities

* "close" is not necessarily physical distance
* discussions and movements can be more ongoing
* physical meetings are still very important and act as roots

## Open-source communities

* work-centered
* sometimes makes community-effort take the back seat
* commercial interest gives both momentum and friction

## Work-Centered
{:.cover .Picture .WorkCentered .noHead}

![Work Driven](pictures/full_metal/work_driven.png)

## Moderation

Communities live through moderation.

## Moderation

Wikitionary:

> An instance of moderating: bringing something away from extremes, especially in a beneficial way

> The process of moderating a discussion

## Moderation

Wikitionary (german, translated)

> Shape, steer a discussion

## Unmoderated spaces are worth nothing

* They deteriorate quickly
* Literally unguided
* Are open to disturbances
* Attract uncooperative people

I don't want to be in a space where a simple question can lead to an attack!

## Moderated vs. open

There is no versus.

Moderated spaces are often more open than unmoderated.

## Organizers/Moderators

* Forum/chat moderators
* Mailing list moderators
* Event organizers (meetups, conferences)
* Bugtracker work/Release planning

...Anyone who wants to mold and change the community.

## Thor

* Moderators often wield the ban-hammer
* Can decide things on their own
* Can generally not easily be held accountable
* Are perfectly within their rights when expelling people

It's their show.

## **Communicators**

## Important traits

* Good at discourse
  - discussions about music are good training
* Seriousness
* Empathy
* Ethics

...Being able to get hold of a good Barista is completely optional.

## Backchannels

Backchannels are the most important tool.

* to deal with personal things
* criticism without accusations
* to organize concerted action and behaviours

...Thats why you rarely see organization happening in the open.

## Backchannels

Backchannels are subject to moderation as much as everything else.

* No insults
* No shaming other people
* Keep your inside consistent to your outside
* Venting is allowed and important
  - Keep a transient channel for that

## Backchannel fanfic

Given a pull request named:

> Use neutral language throughout the project

## Mails


    From: maintainer1
    To: maintainer2

    Hey, do we really need this?
    I don't really see the point of all this.


## Mails

    From: maintainer2
    To: maintainer1
    
    Yes, I support that and some people
    obviously care deeply. I also think it
    improves our docs.

## Mails

    From: maintainer1
    To: maintainer2
    
    I still don't see the point, but I also
    don't see the need for a deep discussion.
    Do you merge or shall I?

## Convincement

One convinced person is often enough, as many are indifferent.

## And they merged happily ever after

## Time

Impactful action takes time. Expect days after
any event for people to get everything together.

Example: [Ruby Berlin Community Statement](http://rubyberlin.org/2013-10-statement-community.html) was 4 days of work.

## Twitter

Good for:

* Outreach
* Announcements
* The odd question

## Twitter

Bad for:

* discourse
* almost anything else of interest for organizers
* ...being used as an engine for change

## **Be wary of shitstorms**

## **Think before you tweet**

## Global Change (without Twitter)

1. have an agenda
2. have a looooong breath
3. convince others

## Global Change

1. start locally
2. introduce and validate your ideas there
3. control your message
4. spread to other subcommunities

## **Outreach**

## No-gos

* Don't pressure people into opinions or statements
* Don't attack unconvincable people
  - You can shun them, if you want to

## **Base Democracy**

## **Wait, Politics???**

## **Everything's political**

## **My Agenda**

## **1. Opposition**

## Problematic Characters

* Trolls, Professional Cynics, Devils Advocates
* Help Vampires
* People incapable of respecting personal space
* Everyone scaring off beginners

## Problematic Characters

Everyone should be welcome, but:

* be called out for misbehaving
* shown the door for repeat offences

## Do we need to be bad?

* An technical wonderchild should not be allowed to insult others
* New committers should never be chided for incompetence
* People should not be attacked for their inability to speak a language
* Abusive natures should be asked to leave communication to others

Complain politely everywhere you see such behaviour.

## Wait, thought police?

There are thin lines between:

* A pointed comment and dismissal of other peoples hard work
* A joke and an insult

Be careful about the recipient!

## **State your dislike!**

## Have expectations!

Expect organizers to:

* communicate clearly
* bring communities forward
* stay up to speed with current movements
* hold your moral values

## **Polite and thoughtful**

## **Backchannel!**

## Sad truth

I've seen all of this happening:

* anonymous and open attacks
* threats and exposures
* discrimination because of disabilities
* mobbing with impersonations

Programming communities are no different.

## We need to moderate the 1%

[Ryan Davis - Why we need to moderate the 1%](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1085-cascadiaruby2012-occupy-ruby-why-we-need-to-moderate-the-1)

## **2. Diversity**

## Diversity

> Is that really a topic? - me, 5 years ago

> Yes, and its much more fun like that. - me, today

## Diversity

Diversity is much more than bringing woman (back) into the industry.

...Diversity is about allowing anyone to participate who shares our basic interests and morals.

...Diversity is a mindset, not a list of boxes to tick.


## **Who is not here?**

## Individuals

Everyone has very particular and personal
reasons for not participating. Not
all can be cared for, but many.

## **Don't dismiss**

## Don't dismiss

Good organizers can support others even if they
cannot relate to their problems.

## **Empathy & Seriousness**

## Codification

Wouldn't it be nice if we could write that down for everyone to see?

## **Code of Conduct**

## They are working!

> Without a Code of Conduct, I wouldn't have come to Ruby Sauna.
> I feared that the organizers weren't aware of the inherent problems of
> the format, the CoC cleared that up.

## Accessibility

[eurucamp accessibility statement](http://2014.eurucamp.org/accessibility/)

Conferences caring about accessiblity and promoting that are rare today. Even small efforts matter.

##Mentorship

[eurucamp mentorship programme](http://cfp.eurucamp.org/mentorship/)

Community response was very good and we have a 1:1 match of speakers to mentors.

## It's a lot of work

* Appreciate those that do it
* Accept failures
* Build networks to ease it

## 3. More inter-community relationships

We don't need to do all that work alone.

## A final quote

> I’m always uncomfortable at a lot of conferences because I don’t party, and I’m always left to feel like that’s bad, especially as a speaker.

> And I personally feel bad b/c I feel like I’m being anti-social (esp if I’m a speaker), but I don’t like being around stupidly drunk people.

## **No**
